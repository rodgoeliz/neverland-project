                <b>Why We Started Neverland</b>
              </h4>
              <p>
                We wanted a better plant-growing experience. Like so many people, we struggled with keeping plants alive
                and thriving in our small city apartments. We’d go to a store, find a plant (okay, more like five
                plants) that we liked, and bring them home. Quality was always questionable, sustainability was
                non-existent, and we struggled to learn how to properly take care of our new friends to their detriment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plant industry hasn’t evolved since the 60s. It’s ruled by massive conventional superstores or
                incredibly overpriced boutiques—and you’re stuck with these choices. An overwhelming majority of plants
                are grown using conventional fertilizers and pesticides. We got frustrated and fed up with poor quality
                products, conventionally grown and not sustainable options, and terrible customer experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know the experience of buying, growing, and caring for plants can be different. Plants can be sourced
                from organic farms that value sustainability and practice regenerative agriculture, not conventional
                factories. Technology can be infused in the experience to make growing and taking care of plants easy
                and fun. Plants meet tech. We help people connect with nature from the ground up.

              </h4>
              <p>
                In our increasingly urbanized and technology-dependent lifestyles, it’s more important than ever to
                rediscover a closer relationship with nature. Neverland is a modern plant company powered by technology
                and community. Our mission is to connect people with nature to improve overall well-being through the
                power of plants and technology.

                All of our seeds, greenery, soils, and plant foods are produced by small, organic farmers that are
                leading the way in sustainability, regenerative agriculture, and premium quality. Sustainability is a
                top priority for us.

              <p>
                Plants are the antidote to modern day stressors and bring joy and beauty to our living and working
                spaces. Studies have shown that plants improve air quality, reduce stress, boost immunity, improve
                mental health and well-being, increase productivity, and can even help patients recover from injury more
                quickly.
